***A elegant ebook reader and discovery platform***  
Page is an elegant ebook reader and discovery app. It uses svelte with typescript for the frontend, 
go for the backend and postgresql for the database.

Goals:
- Cross platform experience
- The ability to search/buy different ebooks
- Speech to text for a authentic audiobook experience
- Nice app UI/UX, especially for the ebook paginated rendering
- Interoperate with different services (Amazon, Apple itunes, Google Play ...)

This project is currently still actively being developped.
